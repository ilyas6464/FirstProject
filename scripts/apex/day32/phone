//public is a keyword to define access level 
//known as access modifier, there are couple of them we will learn later
//Private(meaning it's accessible in same class)
//If do not use public on variable (or method)
//it's automatically private
//class : indicate this is a class 
//phone : identifier ,the name of the class 
// { any code need to go in here ,can not go out side }
// The moment a class exists, it can be a DataType
// meaning , you can create a variable of that type
// you can create a new instance (object) of that type and assign to the variable
// and much more 
public class Phone{
    // a phone has below 
    // attributes or characteristics 
    // brand, price, memory size 
    // instance variable | field
